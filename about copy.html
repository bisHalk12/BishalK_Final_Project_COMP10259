    <h2>About</h2>
    <p1>Clownfish or anemonefish are fishes from the subfamily Amphiprioninae in the family Pomacentridae. Thirty species of clownfish are recognized: one in the genus Premnas, while the remaining are in the genus Amphiprion. In the wild, they all form symbiotic mutualisms with sea anemones. Depending on the species, anemonefish are overall yellow, orange, or a reddish or blackish color, and many show white bars or patches. The largest can reach a length of 17 cm (6+1⁄2 in), while the smallest barely achieve 7–8 cm (2+3⁄4–3+1⁄4 in).</p1>
<br><br><h2>Where clownfish Live?</h2>
<p>Clown fish live in warm, shallow parts of the Indian and Pacific oceans. They inhabit coral reefs where sea anemones are found. Each fish makes its home among the tentacles of an anemone, called the host. A dominant female, her male mate, and a few young clown fish may live within one anemone. The fish are not harmed by the anemone’s stinging cells, which can kill other sea creatures. The close relationship between clown fish and anemones is called symbiosis.
</p><br>
<h2>Gender</h2>
<p>Clownfish can change gender. They start as immature males, then convert to mature male, then convert to female. In nature, a single anemone may be home to many clownfish, each with about a 20% size difference from one individual to the next. The largest is always female, the second largest is the mature male, and the rest are immature. If any individual dies, all the fish below that one simply move up one rung on the ladder. It usually takes them about one month to make the change. They cannot go back down though. So a small female in the presence of a larger female cannot go back to being male. This is why it’s important to be careful about creating a pair at home. If you have a female and you go to the store and find a great clown that is half the size of your female, if the one in the store has been alone for at least two months, it’s a female. If it was already a mature male and has been alone in the shop for a month, it’s now a female. If you take her home to your female, they will not get along at all even though they are so different in size and it won’t get better since she can’t change back.

    Clownfish for a Reef Aquarium
    I usually recommend sticking to just a single pair of clownfish. They are territorial and aggressive, so it’s too risky to try to keep multiple pairs together, even in a larger tank. If you want to keep a group together, I highly recommend you get them all at the same time from the same tank at the store so you know you don’t have multiple females or males. You may have to special order them, especially if you want multiple varieties to be part of your group, but it can be worth it.</p>
   <br> <h2>Diet</h2>
   <p>Anemonefish are omnivorous and can feed on undigested food from their host anemones, and the fecal matter from the anemonefish provides nutrients to the sea anemone. Anemonefish primarily feed on small zooplankton from the water column, such as copepods and tunicate larvae, with a small portion of their diet coming from algae, with the exception of Amphiprion perideraion, which primarily feeds on algae.[2][3]
   </p><br>
   <h2>Physical Features</h2>
   <p>Clown fish can grow to a length of about 4 inches (10 centimeters). Females are larger than males. Most types of clown fish have bright white stripes on a colorful body. In true and false clown fish, the body is usually orange. Three wide, white bars circle the body. The white bars and the fins are outlined in black. The black outlines are thicker in true clown fish.

    A thin layer of mucus covers a clown fish’s body. The mucus protects the fish from being stung by its host anemone.

   <h2>Reproduction</h2>
   <p>In a group of anemonefish, a strict dominance hierarchy exists. The largest and most aggressive female is found at the top. Only two anemonefish, a male and a female, in a group reproduce – through external fertilization. Anemonefish are protandrous sequential hermaphrodites, meaning they develop into males first, and when they mature, they become females. If the female anemonefish is removed from the group, such as by death, one of the largest and most dominant males becomes a female.[16] The remaining males move up a rank in the hierarchy. Clownfish live in a hierarchy, like hyenas, except smaller and based on size not sex, and order of joining/birth.[citation needed]

    Anemonefish lay eggs on any flat surface close to their host anemones. In the wild, anemonefish spawn around the time of the full moon. Depending on the species, they can lay hundreds or thousands of eggs. The male parent guards the eggs until they hatch about 6–10 days later, typically two hours after dusk.</p>
